Each competition is graded by either:

1. **Timer** - How fast you can complete the task

2. **Score** - How many points you can get in the allotted time

After each team completes the tasks, points will be award from 1st to last place - 8 points for first, 7 points for second, 6 points for third - all the way down

At the end of all 10 games, winner is the team with the most points

## Ties

There are no tie breakers. If any teams tie, they share the same amount of points, and the next lowest score gets points for their spot
